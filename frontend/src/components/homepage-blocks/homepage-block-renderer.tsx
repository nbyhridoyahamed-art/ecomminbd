/**
 * The block registry's storefront-rendering half (spec section 60). One
 * switch, not "one giant conditional renderer" per block's markup — each
 * case delegates immediately to that type's own renderer component,
 * passing only the settings/resolved-data slice it needs. Every case is
 * wrapped in the same BlockStyleScope so design/responsive/visibility/
 * animation apply identically regardless of type. `two_column_banner`/
 * `three_column_banner` share one component (same shape, fixed array
 * length); `testimonials`/`reviews` read the same resolved data but render
 * through two visually distinct components.
